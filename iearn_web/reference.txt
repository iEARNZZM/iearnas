    SOLUTION:

    1.  pip install pylint-flask
    2.  Load the installed plugin.

    For example, if you use VS code, please edit settings.json file as follows:
    ('settings.json' file is at %APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json)

    insert this line at the end:
    "python.linting.pylintArgs": ["--load-plugins", "pylint-flask"]
